# UI Update Documentation Requirements

## Current Status
- Backend (FastAPI + PostGIS) is running and correctly serving Spatial Data (2D, 3D Network, 3D Tiles)
- Frontend (React + Vite, Cesium) is successfully fetching and rendering the data.

## Objectives for UI Updates
(Please outline the required UI changes below)

## Functional Requirements
- add a perspective buttom on the right bottom, it makes the user can change their presepectives, e.g. one-click to go from human's ground level and face to north, and humand's ground level to south..... and one click back to the bird presepecetive.; provide mulitple buttom for this function
- add one more layer: '/Users/adelachu/Desktop/WWU/Analysis-Spatio/^Project/FinalReport/Case1_layer/hdb_footprints.geojson', i think it should be added to the api as well for the consistency
- add a data bar now on the top left to be a expanable bar, when user click on the bar, they can 1. select the layer, 2. change colour of the layer, and 3. change transparency of the layer
- add a info bar on the bottom bar
- allow user to click on the polygon and info will show up on the info bar (if there are multiple visible layer show) all of them will turn yellow and show in a table form, the clicking result should be accumulated.
- the hdb footprints should be in 3D
- the visualisation should be more smoother
- default visible layer only building layer & 3D layer
- the layer source box can be removed, the layer should be in the data bar
- it required more time to load the building layer, using a circle load icon on the middle of the screen to show the wating process, it loading animation should end when the building is succesfully loaded.
## Aesthetic Requirements
- 3D layer cannot change colour but the transparency only
- the default colour of the 3D layer is based on the
