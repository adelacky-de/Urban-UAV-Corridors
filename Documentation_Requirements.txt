# UI Update Documentation Requirements

## Current Status
- Backend (FastAPI + PostGIS) is running and correctly serving Spatial Data (2D, 3D Network, 3D Tiles)
- Frontend (React + Vite, Cesium) is successfully fetching and rendering the data.

## Objectives for UI Updates
(Please outline the required UI changes below)

## Functional Requirements
- add a srolling ball on the right bottom, it makes the user can scroll their presepectives
- add one more layer: '/Users/adelachu/Desktop/WWU/Analysis-Spatio/^Project/FinalReport/Case1_layer/hdb_footprints.geojson', i think it should be added to the api as well for the consistency
- add a data bar now on the top left to be a expanable bar, when user click on the bar, they can 1. select the layer, 2. change colour of the layer, and 3. change transparency of the layer
- add a info bar on the bottom bar
- allow user to click on the polygon and info will show up on the info bar (if there are multiple visible layer show) all of them will turn yellow and show
- the hdb footprints should be in 3D
- the scrolling ball is a rolling ball user
- the visualisation should be more smoother
- default visible layer only building layer & 3D layer
